# Digital Workplace App Template

An app template for our digital workplace full stack applications.

Built using Tanstack start, tailwind, headlessUI, and daisyUI.

Project is structured following feature sliced design.

We do NOT use server side rendering, it is disabled app wide.

Server side app logic is best kept to server functions. 

API routes are for exposing data to other projects and must be strictly versioned to avoid breaking changes affecting other business areas.
