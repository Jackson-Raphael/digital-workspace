Disregarding the use of slicing in our project structure, the design of this template aims to bring vertical slicing to the Digital Workspace architecture as a whole.

Each instance of this template in practice representing a single slice/project by our team and each slice having Front to Back encapsulation with clear boundries defined by the API.

Strictly enforced custom project structure, styling and linting.
